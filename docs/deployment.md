# Deployment

This guide outlines how to deploy the Unity Catalog server.

## Deploying using tarball
### Prerequisites
- To generate the tarball, run the following command in the source code:
  ```sh
  build/sbt createTarball
  ```
### Unpacking the tarball
- The tarball generated in the `target` directory can be unpacked using the following command:
  ```sh
  tar -xvf unitycatalog-<version>.tar.gz
  ```
- Unpacking the tarball will create the following directory structure:
  ```
  unitycatalog-<version>
  ├── bin
  │   ├── start-uc-server
  │   └── uc
  ├── etc
  │   ├── conf
  │   ├── data
  │   ├── db
  │   └── logs
  └── jars
  ```
  - The `bin` directory contains the scripts that you can use to start the UC server and run the CLI as explained in the [tutorial section](tutorial.md).
  - The `etc` directory contains the configuration, data, database, and logs directories.
  - The `jars` directory contains the jar files required to run the UC server.

### Configuring the UC server
- The UC server can be configured by modifying the files in `etc/conf/`. This includes properties related to logging, server environment and the s3 configuration.
  - Setting the server environment to `dev` will use the local file system for storing the backend database whereas `test` will spin up an in-memory database.
- The `etc/data/` directory contains the data files that are used by the UC server. This includes the tables and volumes that are created.
- The `etc/db/` directory contains the backend database that is used by the UC server.
